# The BioTracs project?

The biotracs project aims at providing an open community-driven analytics platform. It is an effort for standardizing the implementation and traceability of analytics workflows in bioinformatics. 

Biotracs provides an environment where developers and non-expert users can implement, use and share their analyses while ensuring *traceability* and *transparency* in their computational processes.
Initiated at BIOASTER, the biotracs project is today open to the community in order to bring this architecture to the whole bioinformatics community. 

The key idea behind the biotracs framework is to ultimately provide a community-driven analytics platform where computational processes are traceable, upgradable and easily sharable at the code, application and scientific project levels.

# Behind BioTracs

Biotracs framework is based on the PRISM (Process-Resource Interfacing SysteM) architecture designed at BIOASTER [(wiki page coming soon!)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Process-resource-interfacing-system). 
The PRISM architecture was designed on the basis of the well-known MVC (model-view-controller) architecture (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller). Biotracs is therefore MVC-oriented. 
PRISM ambitions to provide an environment in which developers and end-users can concurrently contribute to the same applications while guaranteeing that what is implemented by the developers at the code level is what is delivered to the end-users with almost no supplementary effort.
