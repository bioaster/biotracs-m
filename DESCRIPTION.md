# Biotracs projects

The biotracs project is an effort for standardizing bioinformatics workflows implementations. 
Biotracs framework is based on the PRISM (Process-Resource Interfacing SysteM) architecture. It provides a library that allows to model computational workflows and ensure process traceability. 
It allows expert developpers and non-expert users to implements, use and share their analyses while ensuring traceability in their computational processes.
Initiated at BIOASTER, the biotracs project is today open to the community in order to bring this architecture to the whole bioformatics community.
